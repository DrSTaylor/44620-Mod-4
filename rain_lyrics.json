"44 ContributorsBox of Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLook out of any window\nAny morning, any evening, any day\nMaybe the sun is shining\nBirds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWhat do you want me to do\nTo do for you to see you through?\nFor this is all a dream we dreamed\nOne afternoon, long ago\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk out of any doorway\nFeel your way, feel your way like the day before\nMaybe you'll find direction\nAround some corner where it's been waiting to meet you\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWhat do you want me to do\nTo watch for you while you are sleeping?\nThen please don't be surprised\nWhen you find me dreaming, too\n\n[Guitar Solo]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nLook into any eyes you find by you\nYou can see clear through to another day\nMaybe it's been seen before through other eyes\nOn other days while going home\n\n[Chorus 3]\nWhat do you want me to do\nTo do for you, to see you through?\nIt's all a dream we dreamed\nOne afternoon, long ago\n\n[Verse 4]\nWalk into splintered sunlight\nInch your way through dead dreams to another land\nMaybe you're tired and broken\nYour tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear\n\n[Chorus 4]\nWhat do you want me to do\nTo do for you, to see you through?\nA box of rain will ease the pain\nAnd love will see you through\n\n[Verse 5]\nJust a box of rain, wind, and water\nBelieve it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on\nSun and shower, wind and rain\nIn and out the window like a moth before a flame\n[Outro]\nAnd it's just a box of rain\nI don't know who put it there\nBelieve it if you need it\nOr leave it if you dare\nAnd it's just a box of rain\nOr a ribbon for your hair\nSuch a long long time to be gone\nAnd a short time to be there8Embed"
